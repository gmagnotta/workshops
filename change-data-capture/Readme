# Change Data Capture lab

This lab is used to demonstrate on how to use Change Data Capture with debezium

## Prerequirements

A Kafka cluster already running and configured

Before starting Debezium, the postgresql should be configured to create
publication for all tables.

## Description

Provision the ansible playbook playbook_cdc.yaml.

It will create a Kafka User for debezium, a Kafka Connect cluster,
a Connector to start debezium on postgresql an user for Kafka Streams client
(quarkus-order-streams) and an user for reading aggregated data (quarkus-order-logger).

## Setup

After the playbook is played, debezium will connect to the postgresql database
and will start populate jboss.public.orders, jboss.public.line_items and 
jboss.public.items topics on Kafka with content coming from the database.

At this point you can deploy the application quarkus-order-streams.
The application will perform stream processing to aggregate data and emit
ordercreated events into the outbox.event.OrderCreated

It will calculate also biggest orders (topOrders topic) and most sold items
(topItems topic).

At this point you can deploy the application quarkus-order-logger.
The application will read events from outbox.event.OrderCreated and will show
on screen the content.
If configured correctly, the application can also send messages via telegram.
