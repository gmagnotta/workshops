Developer users can monitor only projects where they have the view role permissions.

Use the following command to grant view role permissions to a user or group

oc create rolebinding view --clusterrole=view --user=user -n project
oc create rolebinding view --clusterrole=view --group=group -n project

oc get rolebindings -n project
