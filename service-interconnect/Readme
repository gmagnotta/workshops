# Service interconnect lab

This lab is used to demonstrate on how service interconnect work inside OCP

## East cluster

The east cluster is the one providing services that needs to be accessed from others.
It must be publictly reachable.

On this cluster run playbook_service-interconnect_east.yaml

When the playbook terminates, you can expose the needed deployments. Eg.:

`skupper expose deployment/postgresql --port 5432`

## West cluster

The west cluster is the one that needs to access the services provided by the east cluster
and it's not required that it's publicitly reachable. The only requirement is that
it is cable to connect to east cluster.

On this cluster run playbook_service-interconnect_west.yaml

## Troubleshoot

You can use `skupper status` or `skupper link status` to check what is going on.
